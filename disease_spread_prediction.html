                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the
                    world.
                    In mild cases,
                    symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue
                    fever can cause severe
                    bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in
                    Southeast Asia and the
                    western Pacific islands, but the disease has been increasing rapidly in Latin America and the
                    Caribbean. This project aimed to establish a statistical model to predict the number of
                    dengue cases in
                    two Latin American
                    cities.
                </p>

                <h2>Effect of Climate on Dengue Spread</h2>
                <p>
                    Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate
                    variables such as
                    temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of
                    scientists argue
                    that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public
                    health implications
                    worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research
                    initiatives and resource
                    allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics. Using environmental data collected by the
                    Centre for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and the
                    National Oceanic and
                    Atmospheric Administration in the U.S.A, we set out to predict the number of dengue fever cases
                    reported each week in
                    San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Description</h2>
                <p>
                    To model the dengue fever incidence, several climatic factors like air temperature (min, max, avg),
                    diurnal temperature
                    range, specific humidity, relative humidity, precipitation, etc. were used as explanatory variables.
                    Weekly climate data
                    were collected from three sources:
                </p>
                <li> Daily climate data from the weather station</li>
                <li>Satellite measurements</li>
                <li>Climate Forecast System Reanalysis measurements</li>

                <br> <br>
                <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
                <h3>Missing Value Imputation</h3>
                <p>
                    Any missing values are imputed with the average of bounding non-missing values. Missing values in
                    the
                    margins of a
                    series were replaced with forwarding fill (or backward fill) imputations.
                </p>

                <h3>Outlier Treatment</h3>
                <p>
                    In the dependent variable (total cases of dengue), the presence of outliers was visually inspected
                    and
                    confirmed. So, the Hampel
                    filter was used for outlier treatment.
                </p>

                <h3>Hampel Filter</h3>
                <p>
                    Hampel filter is used to identify and remove outliers in time series data. It uses a sliding window
                    of configurable
                    width to go over the data. For each window, we calculate the median. Then the standard deviation is
                    estimated from the
                    median absolute deviation
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    For the MAD to be a consistent estimator for the standard deviation, we must multiply it by a
                    constant scale factor k.
                    The factor is dependent on the distribution, for Gaussian it is approximately 1.48.
                </p>
                <p>If: <u>Observed value > Window median + X*SD</u>, then, we treat it as an outlier and replace it with
                    the median.
                </p> -->
                <p>The Hampel filter has two configurable parameters:</p>
                <li>The size of the sliding window</li>
                <li>The number of standard deviations which identify the outlier</li>
                <p>
                    We selected these two parameters depending on the use-case and now the data is processed and is
                    ready for modeling.
                </p>
                <p></p>

                <h2>Statistical Modelling</h2>
                <p>
                    The approach taken to solve the problem at hand was to use an ensemble of models. A Negative
                    binomial regression was
                    employed to predict the spread of dengue with climate variables as input. Time Series forecasting
                    was done using a
                    SARIMA model. Then the results of both the models were averaged to get the final prediction.
                </p>

                <h3>SARIMA</h3>
                <p>
                    Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are widely used to forecast time series
                    data.
                    <br>
                    SARIMA stands for Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving models and are used to forecast time
                    series with
                    seasonality present in it. A SARIMA model has the following hyperparameters:
                </p>
                <li> <b>p:</b> AR order.</li>
                <li> <b>d:</b> differencing order</li>
                <li> <b>q:</b> MA order</li>
                <li> <b>P:</b> Seasonal AR order</li>
                <li> <b>D:</b> Seasonal differencing order</li>
                <li> <b>Q:</b> Seasonal MA order</li>
                <li> <b>S:</b> length of a period</li>
                <p>
                    A SARIMA model uses differencing at a lag equal to S, for removing additive seasonal effects. As
                    with lag equal to 1
                    differencing for removing a trend. It also includes autoregressive and moving average terms at lag
                    S.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our prediction scenario,
                </p>
                <li>As there is no integrating effect in the total cases observed, d was set to 0</li>
                <li>Appropriate values for q and p can be found from ACF and PACF plots respectively</li>
                <li>S was chosen as 52 as the seasonality in climate data is observed every year.</li>
                <li>P and Q were found from the PACF and ACF plots by looking at the correlation values near the length
                    of a period</li>
                <p>A SARIMA model was built using the chosen parameters and predictions were made.</p>

                <h3>Negative Binomial Regression</h3>
                <p>
                    Negative binomial regression is a Supervised Machine Learning technique which is generally used to
                    predict count
                    variables, usually for over-dispersed count data (i.e.) when the variance exceeds the mean. As the
                    weekly number of
                    dengue cases reported was over-dispersed, an NBM model was used to forecast it with climate
                    parameters as independent
                    variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lag variables were created with climate data and features with good predictability were chosen. For
                    feature selection, a
                    random forest model was fitted to the raw data, and variables with high feature importance (based on
                    GINI score) were
                    selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hyperparameter tuning was done using cross-validation and the final model was trained using Collab
                    GPUs.
                </p>

                <h2>Further Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    A final forecast was made by taking the average of predictions made by both SARIMA and Negative
                    Binomial models. The
                    models were validated on a holdout dataset, and the final performance was recorded as an MSE of
                    14.8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dengue cases are subjected to various factors as briefly found in the scope of this project. A lot
                    of external
                    parameters such as vegetation index, population density, and other socio-economic factors have heavy
                    control over the
                    spread of dengue. A further stretch of this work will lead to more accurate predictions, which would
                    aid governments and
                    healthcare workers in suppressing the spread of dengue.
